Spread models are a special kind of model flows, in the sense that they are multi-stage with parallel children
(quite like a combination of Serial and Parallel flows) but in an internal ecosystem we could compare to an
Excel spreadsheet but in N dimensions. This comes like this:

1. The whole model will involve a space of N dimensions, each indexed from 0 to potentially infinite.
2. This model will consist of several "data blocks" which we may understand as "tensors" inside that space.
3. Such tensors will have cells (N-dimensional cells) with content being:
   - If no data in the cell, it will become 0.
   - If the data is a number, it will be wrapped into a "big" number.
   - If the data is a "big" number, it will be wrapped into an expression.
   - If the data is an expression, it will be wrapped into a Single Output Model.
     - The name of the output variable will be "CELL:<X>" for N=1, "CELL:<X>:<Y>" for N=2, ...
       In this case: X, Y... are non-negative integers.
   - The data in the cell may be any kind of model.
